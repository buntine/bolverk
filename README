1) Definition

  Bolverk is an emulator for a typical machine language. I have developed it in an attempt to
  better understand the way machines work at a low-level and potentially as an educational tool
  for students who prefer to see a machine language is action.

  With Bolverk, you can write a machine language program, and then step through the operation one
  "machine cycle" at time. At each point, you can dissect main memory and all registers. This is a
  great way to see how the program effects memory.

  Programs are written in hexadecimal. The language design is based on the one described
  in J. Glenn Brookshears textbook -- Computer Science: An Overview (3rd edition, 1991).

2) Architecture

  - The machine has 16 registers identified in hexadecimal as 0 through to F.
  - Each register can hold 8 bits (one byte).
  - Main memory consists of 256 cells.
  - Each memory cell can hold 8 bits (one byte).
  - Memory cells can be referenced in hexadecimal as 00 (00000000) to FF (11111111).

3) Machine Language

  - Machine instructions are 16 bits (two bytes) in length, therefore each instruction requires two memory cells.
  - The first 4 bits make up the op-code. The following 12 bits make up the operand field.
  - See the LANGUAGE_SPEC document for a listing of the available instrctions.
