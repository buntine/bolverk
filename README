1) Definition

  Bolverk is an emulator for a typical machine language. I have developed it in an attempt to
  better understand the way machines work at a low-level and potentially as an educational tool
  for students who prefer to see a machine language in action in a virtual environment.

  With Bolverk, you can write a machine language program, and then step through the operation one
  "machine cycle" at time. At each point, you can dissect main memory and all registers. This is a
  great way to see how the program effects memory in realtime.

  Programs are written in base-16 (hexadecimal). The language design is based on the one described
  in J. Glenn Brookshears textbook -- Computer Science: An Overview (3rd edition, 1991).

2) Architecture

  - The machine has 16 registers identified in hexadecimal as 0 through to F.
  - Each register can hold one byte (8 bits).
  - Main memory consists of 256 cells.
  - Each memory cell can hold one byte.
  - Memory cells can be referenced in hexadecimal as 00 (00000000) to FF (11111111).

3) Machine Language

  - Machine instructions are 16 bits (two bytes) in length, therefore each instruction requires two memory cells.
  - The first 4 bits make up the op-code. The following 12 bits make up the operand field.
  - See the LANGUAGE_SPEC document for a listing of the available instructions.

2) Storing Integers and Fractions

  In order to handle negative values, the emulator stores integers as 8-bit and encoded in
  Two's Complement Notation. Therefore, the range of numbers than can be stored is -125 to 124. This should
  be sufficient for educational purposes.

  Fractions are stored in Floating Point Notation using the following layout: 0 000 0000

    1)    Sign bit.
    2..4) Exponent field, encoded in Excess Four Notation
    5..8) Mantissa field

  It's worth noting that my Floating Point implemenation is very limited as only one byte is reserved per number. Therefore,
  round-off errors and overflows are going to be rather common unless you are dealing with a very small range of numbers (1/256 to 7 1/2).
