=========================================

1) Disclaimer

   The machine language implemented into Bolverk is based largely on the language described
   in Appendix B of the textbook "Computer Science: An Overview" by J. Glenn Brookshear (ISBN
   0-8053-0264-6).

   I have changed and added things wherever I saw fit.

2) Notes

   Each operand consists of hexadecimal digits. R, S and T represtent registers whereas X and Y
   represent non-register values (such as a memory cell).

3) Operations

   Op-Code | Operand | Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       1   |   RXY   | LOAD the register R with the contents of the memory cell whose address is XY.
       2   |   RXY   | LOAD the resister R with the value XY.
       3   |   RXY   | STORE the contents of register R in the memory cell whose address is XY.
       4   |   0RS   | MOVE the contents of register R to register S (acts as a COPY).
       5   |   STR   | ADD the contents of registers S and T as though they were binary numbers and
           |         | store the result in register R.
       6   |   STR   | ADD the contents of registers S and T as though they were floating-point numbers
           |         | and store the result in register R.
       7   |   STR   | OR the contents of registers S and T and store the contents in register R.
       8   |   STR   | AND the contents of registers S and T and store the contents in register R.
       9   |   STR   | EXCLUSIVE OR (XOR) the contents of registers S and T and store the contents
                       in register R.
       A   |   R0X   | ROTATE the contents of register R to the right, in a circular-motion X times.
       B   |   RXY   | JUMP to the instruction stored at the memory cell XY if the contents of register
                       R is equal to the contents of register 0. Otherwise, continue onto the next
                       instruction as per normal.
       C   |   000   | HALT execution and reset the program counter.
       D   |   MXY   | PRINT the contents of the memory cell whose address is XY to the standard output.
                       The M parameter indicates the type of data:
                       0 => ASCII character
                       1 => Binary number (as decimal)
                       2 => Floating-point number
       E   |   MXY   | PRINT the value represented by XY to the standard output.
                       The M parameter indicates the type of data:
                       0 => ASCII character
                       1 => Binary number (as decimal)
                       2 => Floating-point number
