    Bolverk is an emulator for a typical machine language. I have developed it in an attempt to
    better understand the way machines work at a low-level and potentially as an educational tool
    for students who prefer to see a machine language in action in a virtual environment.

    With Bolverk, you can write a machine language program, and then step through the operation one
    "machine cycle" at time. At each point, you can dissect main memory and all registers. This is a
    great way to see how the program effects memory in realtime.

    Programs are written in base-16 (hexadecimal). The language design is based on the one described
    in J. Glenn Brookshears textbook -- Computer Science: An Overview (3rd edition, 1991).
